    One of the aims of Pan-African Baraza is to amplify the voices of those campaigning for social justice and emancipation across the pan-African world. We welcome you to participate in these campaigns. And if you want us to feature campaigns in which you are involved, you can do so directly on the site or send your suggestions to editors@panafricanbaraza.org.

    Pan-African Baraza welcomes you and your organisation to join the community of pan-African activists, organisations, social movements and engaged intellectuals committed to the cause of emancipation. We will soon be setting up a facility for special interest groups to establish their own zone on the site where they can discuss, organise and share content with the Pan-African Baraza community.
